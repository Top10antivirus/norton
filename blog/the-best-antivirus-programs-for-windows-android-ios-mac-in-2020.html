Before we can make a recommendation, an antivirus product must meet these requirements:</p><ul class="leftbullet"><li><strong>Strong protection against all types of malware.</strong> We only endorse software that has a proven track record against the newest malware threats. Viruses are just one type of malware — Nowadays your devices need protection against spyware, rootkits, ransomware, and anything else that could cause you harm online.</li><li><strong>Minimum drag on system resources.</strong> Our top list only includes programs that are lightweight and don't slow down your computer (even if it's not the newest model).</li><li><strong>Easy and User-Friendly.</strong> Because everyone needs malware protection, no matter how tech-savvy, our top recommendations are all easy to set up and use.</li><li><strong>Packed with extra security features.</strong> The antivirus programs we recommend offer improvements to your device’s native security systems beyond protection against malware.</li><li><strong>Great value for money.</strong> Our top picks all have money back guaratees so you can try before you buy. They also offer packages for protecting numerous devices and a bunch of added features that make getting online protection a valuable investment indeed.</li></ul><div class="hl-box hl-box-red"><h2>Well-Known Brands That We Don't Recommend:</h2><p>You may notice that <strong>some popular antivirus brands are not listed here.</strong> Note that there are over 50 antivirus brands and we wanted to limit our list to the very best available. There are some pretty famous brands that didn't make the cut because they were not <i>quite</i> good enough to earn one of our top spots.</p><ul class="leftbullet"><li><strong>Avast & AVG.</strong> Avast (who also own AVG) stand accused of selling user data to large corporations for marketing purposes. Due to this scandal, in a time when online privacy has become a real issue, we cannot recommend any Avast products on this site any longer.</li><li><strong>ESET.</strong> This Slovak company makes great antivirus software and contributes immensely to the field of online security, but we believe that it is more suitable for corporations and businesses and that the home edition of its antivirus product is not the most easy to use.</li><li><strong>Kaspersky.</strong> Although the high quality of this antivirus product cannot be denied, there have been allegations about collusion with the Russian government that we cannot ignore at the time of this writing.</li></ul></div><h2 id="TotalAV" class="mt-5">1. <a class="h6-title" href="https://track.totalav.com/5ef0cd87795a6/click/ll21jmyajz1f7eoqxzo0i" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">TotalAV</a> — Best Overall Antivirus Package</h2><h3><a href="https://track.totalav.com/5ef0cd87795a6/click/ll21jmyajz1f7eoqxzo0i" title="Total AV" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><img class="img-fluid" src="../pics/article-totalav-v6.png"></a></h3><p>TotalAV is a relatively new kid on the antivirus block but <strong>it is well known among experts as one of the best</strong>, offering superior protection, many super useful features and simply unbeatable value for money. <a href="../reviews/totalav.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">After our detailed review</a>, we can confidently say that <strong>TotalAV is a fantastic choice.</strong></p><p>TotalAV is an Avira “white label”, meaning that award-winning, German-made Avira’s software powers TotalAV’s antivirus engine. So — although TotalAV is a relatively new brand — it runs on <strong>some of the most trusted cybersecurity technology available.</strong></p><p>What we particularly love about TotalAV is the incredibly simple, easy-to-use design. <strong>It looks great and just feels right, working in the background without harassing you and just doing its job.</strong> If you’re not a tech wizard looking for complicated features, <strong>you’ll love the simplicity of TotalAV.</strong></p><p>TotalAV also ticks all the right boxes when it comes to <strong>the vast range of extra security features,</strong> which include everything but the kitchen sink: <strong>Ransomware protection, password management, a Virtual Private Network and advanced phishing protection.</strong></p><h3>Bottom Line:</h3><p>TotalAV has <strong>one of the most powerful antivirus engines, a great range of features and superior user friendly design.</strong> If you're looking to protect all your devices, download TotalAV!

But there are a bunch of other security features that are also important. If you use only one password for all your logins you should definitely use a password manager. If you download torrents, get a security package that includes a VPN. If you want to protect your whole family, make sure your chosen software includes parental controls like those offered by <strong> <a href="#Norton">Norton 360.</a></strong></li><li><strong>Decide which device you want to protect.</strong> Not all antivirus programs work on all platforms, so you need to make sure your device is covered. Check the <a href="#faq">FAQ section above</a> to see which programs we recommend for each device. If you have an older laptop or PC, make sure the antivirus package you choose will not slow down your system too much. <a href="#TotalAV">TotalAV</a> is a good lightweight choice as you can test if everything still works smoothly for free, before upgrading to the paid version. <li><strong>Decide how many devices you want to protect.</strong> You probably have more than one device such as a mobile phone, laptop and tablet. If you want to protect a bunch of devices, get a package that offers a decent discount for multiple licenses such as <a href="#Norton">Norton</a>. <li><strong>See how easy the software is to use.</strong> Almost all of the top brands on this list offer a “no questions asked” money-back guarantee. Use this time to get to know the software and see if you find it easy to use. If the software annoys you, chat to customer support about it and get a refund. Then go and test another one until you hit gold.</li></ul><div class="hl-box hl-box-green mt-5"><strong>Transparency and Trust:</strong> We have been analysing antivirus software for over 3 years and take pride in the fact that our community of users can contribute and share their reviews on our site.
