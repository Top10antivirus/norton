A clicker is a type of trojan that performs ad fraud by mimicking the user and “clicking” on ads to earn revenue on a pay-per-click basis. <br><br>As of this writing, BearCloud has been downloaded more than 78 million times while Haken has over 50,000 downloads. <br><br>There are countless more examples of harmful apps disguised as functional apps, from fashion apps to subscription scam apps. And if you regularly install apps from unofficial third-party mobile application stores, the risks are even higher. <br><br>So if you’re still wondering if you need antivirus software for your iPad, Amazon Fire HD, Samsung Galaxy tab, or any other tablet, the short answer is a resounding YES! <br><br>Without it, you risk losing your personal information, financial records, important files, irreplaceable photographs, and more. <br><br></br><h3>What We Test For In The Best Antivirus Solution For Tablets</h3><br>There are plenty of reputable security vendors that develop antivirus products tailored specifically for tablet protection. While doing our research and subsequent ranking, we considered the following:<br><br>1. Does it offer all-inclusive protection against viruses, ransomware, spyware, Trojans, worms, and other major threats?<br>2. Does it have a negative impact on working memory and processing speed? <br>3. Does it offer real-time detection and removal of malware infection? <br>4. What extra security features does it provide (if any)? <br>5. Is it reliable, efficient, and easy to use?<br>6. How does it fare in reviews by independent testing labs, user reviews, and consumer reports? <br>7. Does it offer several customer support options - phone, email, and chat?<br><br></br><h3>Must-have features of the leading antivirus apps for tablets:</h3><br>After testing and reviewing some of the most popular utilities from big-name antivirus and security vendors, we can conclude that the best antivirus solution goes beyond protecting your device against traditional types of malware and viruses. <br><br>The security apps we recommend above can also do the following:<br><br>+ Offer real-time device protection as it scans for new viruses and emerging threats 24/7<br>+ Maximizes your tablet’s memory space by scanning and removing junk<br>+ Extends the usage on your battery by turning off or deleting unused and redundant apps<br>+ Offers automatic backup and data recovery protection so you won’t lose a single file ever again<br>+ Comes with a fast and secure VPN for anonymous browsing, streaming, and downloading<br>+ Secure all Wi-Fi networks to prevent hacking when using public networks in cafes, hotels, airports, and more. <br>+ Secure your passwords, addresses, and other important notes through a password manager<br>+ Offers parental control to help you monitor and manage your kids’ devices</div></div></div><div class="container"><div class="row text-left faqs cbody"><div class="col-12 text-md-center"><h2 class="text-responsive mt-4 mt-md-5">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2><h3>Do I still need virus protection on my tablet?</h3><p>Yes! Remember, everything&rsquo;s connected. Your computer is synced to your phone and tablet and practically shares the same access to your files and data. Thus, it is crucial to protect your devices, not just your main computer, equally. After all, if one of your devices gets hacked, everything else is compromised. Thankfully, many of our recommended antiviruses cover multiple devices, so you can protect yourself and your family against the latest virus, malware, adware, and other threats!</p><br><h3>Don&#039;t tablets already come with built-in antivirus protection?</h3><p>Yes, most tablets do. However, built-in security software rarely gets updates, so it can&#039;t keep up with rapidly evolving threats. Besides, it can&#039;t protect you against phishing, identity theft, ransomware, and privacy leaks.</p><br><h3>How can my tablet get infected with malware?</h3><p>There are two common ways to expose your tablet against malware, viruses, Trojans, and other security threats: apps and downloads. When you click an unknown link in your email or open a pop-up ad on a website, cybercriminals can automatically download a malicious file on your device without you even noticing. Downloading apps from third-party stores also exposes you to malware-laden apps that hackers use to steal your password, delete files, and more.</p><br><h3>Can I get rid of viruses by doing a factory reset?</h3><p>Well, a factory reset is one way of potentially removing viruses and malware, but it doesn&#039;t work 100% of the time. Also, doing a factory reset does not merely get rid of potential threats. It gets your phone back to the same state when it first left the factory, erasing photos, videos, files, and saved settings. Why not install decent antivirus software instead? This way, you won&#039;t even have to worry about your tablet getting infected in the first place!</p><br><h3>How do I know if an antivirus program is compatible with my tablet?</h3><p>The top antivirus apps we recommend on this page are all compatible with major tablet brands, including but not limited to: Samsung Galaxy Tab, Apple iPad, Lenovo, Amazon Fire, Huawei, and Xiaomi.</p></div></div></div><script type="application/ld+json">{ "@context": "https://schema.org/", "@type": "FAQPage", "mainEntity": [{"@type": "Question","name": "
